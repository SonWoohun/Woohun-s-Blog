My name is Son Woohun. I think it can be pronounced better by "Sohn Wooheon".

I am interested in many things. Frankly speaking, I frequently get absorbed in things that intrigue me at a point in time. Diving deep into various subjects makes me unaware of the passage of time. However, as soon as the magic ends, I stop driving into those worlds and then precipitously forget about the subjects I once loved. That's why this blog is needed.

This is a blog that was built to archive, share, and introduce my personal interests and the content that I studied. I am interested in keyboards and fountain pens as hobbies and in economics and history as subjects of study right now.

The title of the blog 'Hundred Ancestors One Child' comes from the poem about a massacre of the series of the massacre --
which pertains to the Jeju 4$$\cdot$$3 uprising
-- that was committed around 1950 in Jeju island. Since some portion of the slaughtered people were associated with communism or North Korea, the bereaved families in southwest Jeju could not excavate the bodies of the deceased officially until some years passed. When the remains were discovered, it was impossible to discern the identities because there was only one big chunk of bones. There must have been at least a hundred people. The two representatives of bereaved families, Lee Chihoon and Lee Sungchul, suggested constructing one tombstone for the representative of 132 tombs, inscribed as "The Realm for a Child from Hundred Ancestors".

I was deeply impressed by humanism despite one of the most tragic scenes in the modern history of Korea. Not to lose this sort of warmth myself, I put it as the title of this blog.
