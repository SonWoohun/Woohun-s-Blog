This is the summary of the paper by Kim Min-chul (2010), the title of which is **_<Japanese Colonial Government--General's Control of Korean Countryside and Korean Reaction to It>_**.
The purpose of reading this paper is to classify rural villages at the time $-$ which is beautifully done in this paper $-$ and understand how the type of a village would have affect the construction of Shinto shrines.

## Abstract

In the abstract, the paper is summarized as follows.
> The countryside's resposes to the colonial rule were various: the farm-centered type; the bureaucratic type (guided model village type and ideological control type); the model village type; and self-rule type; and underdeveloped type. The farm-centered type is the type that suppressed the independence of the sharecroppers and satisfied the requirements of the land-capital. The bureaucratic type is composed of two differend subtypes: the guided model village type in which agricultural reform was made by the support of concentrated colonial bureaucratic efforts and the ideological control type in which villages with strong anti-colonial sentiment were domesticated into the imperial ideological system by the support of the bureaucratic support. The model village type is composed of two different categories: the one in which the self-motivation preceded the bureaucratic supports, and the other in which the bureaucratic support preceded the villagers' voluntary efforts. But in these two cases, the ultimate cooperation between the colonial rule and the villagers' voluntarism was made harmoniously, though, as the total war efforts became more detrimental to the self-rule of the villages, the bureaucratic influence suppressed the voluntary desire of the villages, leaving less space for self-rule of the villagers. The self-rule type, composed of villages with more traditional self-rule system and of villages formed with religious goals, was relatively less permeable to the colonial rule. The underdeveloped type is the one in which both villagers' self-rule and the colonial influence were not playing important roles because of its economic underdevelopment.

> Seen from the perspective of 'development', the countryside's responses to the alien influences, that is, the inundation of the colonial rule and commodified money economy, the successfully developed cases of the model villages were resulted from the combination of the village leaders leadership and the villagers' unified efforts. In model villages, renowned leaders and independent farmers led the agricultural reform and other middle-aged town leaders functioned as officials of the youth associations and the Countryside Revival Associations. And the percentage of independent farmers and half-independent farmers in these villages was higher than in other villages, making the unified efforts easier. On the other hand, whether villagers had the same family name or not was also an important factor in a village's response to the colonial rule: the common class, same-family villages responded more actively than the aristocratic, same-family villages; villages with more than two family names.

## I. Introduction

Much of the existing literature fails to show the changes in rural societies under the Japanese colonial rule as a whole. To do this, a classification method is needed to rural societies. In this paper, the criteria of the classification will be the following two: **the extent of the colonial power infiltration to the village** and **the degree of autonomy of the village**. To do this analysis, the auther gathered the information about villages and leaders of villages (about 600 villages and 
800 leaders).

## II. Theoretical Model $-$ the extent of the colonial power infiltration to the village and the degree of autonomy of the village (Unfinished)
