## Abstract

In the abstract, the paper is summarized as follows.
> As the number of Myeons increased which had to worry about their own existence, the Governor-General of Korea took on unifiying Myeons with inferior financial conditions. As a consequence, the division and arrangement of Myeons took place around the nation until the Liberation. The first period (1917~27) witnessed a prominent increase in the number of designated Myeons with the merger of Myeons lagging behind. The second period (1928~36) saw the active arrangement of Myeons driven by the one school for one Myeon system, town planning, and residents' voluntary demand. The third period (1937~45) featured the rapid increase of Eups and the unification of Myeons with poor finance simultaneously. The names of Myeons were first decided based on their own efforts and the unique features of their areas. On a secondary level, names of Myeons were created by borrowing and combining one letter from each of the concerned Myeons. Furthermore, the old names of Myeons were changed due to the unification of names for the seats of Kun offices, adjustment of confusion according to the addition of new administrative districts, and alteration of representative names commonly used in reality. That is, the people of Joseon began to reorganize their own identity based on new administrative districts and names in 1914.
