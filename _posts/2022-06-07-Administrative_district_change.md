This is the summary of the paper by Lee Myeong Hak (2020. 05), the title of which is **_<The Reorganization of Administrative Districts and Changes to Their Names during the Japanese Rule --With a focus on Myeons (面)-->_**.
The reason for reading this paper is to clarify the changes that were executed in rural societies of the Colonial Joseon and understand the motivation for the changes.

## Abstract

In the abstract, the paper is summarized as follows.
> As the number of Myeons increased which had to worry about their own existence, the Governor-General of Korea took on unifiying Myeons with inferior financial conditions. As a consequence, the division and arrangement of Myeons took place around the nation until the Liberation. The first period (1917~27) witnessed a prominent increase in the number of designated Myeons with the merger of Myeons lagging behind. The second period (1928~36) saw the active arrangement of Myeons driven by the one school for one Myeon system, town planning, and residents' voluntary demand. The third period (1937~45) featured the rapid increase of Eups and the unification of Myeons with poor finance simultaneously. The names of Myeons were first decided based on their own efforts and the unique features of their areas. On a secondary level, names of Myeons were created by borrowing and combining one letter from each of the concerned Myeons. Furthermore, the old names of Myeons were changed due to the unification of names for the seats of Kun offices, adjustment of confusion according to the addition of new administrative districts, and alteration of representative names commonly used in reality. That is, the people of Joseon began to reorganize their own identity based on new administrative districts and names in 1914.

## 1. Introduction (unfinished)

The Government-General of Chosen implemented the first administrative district revision in 1914, intending to make each administrative districts that give equal tax revenue. However, such revision was not constructed on the actual administrative needs; thus, Myeons that cannot meet their own expense increased. In reaction to the situation, the authority revised the administrative district rather than implementing a local finance mediation system. The decision was because the Government-General preferred central finance to local finance and was unaware of the importance of local financial balance. Therefore, the foreign government started the revision project on a full scale in the late 1920s.

In most of the cases, the authority had to merge two or more Myeons into one, which outbroke the issue of which name should be used. For the villagers at the time, the name of their Myeon (which is about a scale of town) was touchy matter, since their original name contains the identification of the members. The problem of naming the merged Myeons demanded understandable criteria for the villagers. This is why studying the district revision of 1920s are critical in comprehending the rural governing system.

## 2. The Discussion for the Revision of District and Its Trend

### 1) Issues with the existing administrative district and social consensus of the revision

First of all, the revision that took place can be organized as the table below. We will account for the important changes in the revision that deserves attention. 

Before delivering the content in the paper, I will address some prerequisites. To understand the local administrative district system properly, the comprehension of hierarchy of local district is needed. The largest district is 'Do', which can be thought of as province. 'Gun' is the next largest district but it does not contain 'Bu', and thus 'Bu' and 'Gun' can be regarded as equivalent with respect to the class of district. 'Gun' and 'Bu' together compose 'Do'. Again, 'Myeon' and 'Eup' compose 'Gun'. 'Myeon' can be considered as town while 'Eup' is a little developed than 'Myeon'. Conveniently, Eup can be seen as a district class that is between Myeon and Bu, but cannot standalone as Bu.

'Do (道)'-'Bu (府)'-'Gun (府)'-'Eup (邑)'-'Myeon (面)' are terms that were already being used in the Joseon dynasty, but some of them changed it's concept. 'Bu' were similar with 'Gun' in their composition. They had a large city and several 'Myeon's. But after the revision in 1914, only the large city inside the traditional 'Bu' were classified as 'Bu' and the Myeons inside it are reclassified into 'Gun' around the 'Bu'. Moreover, 'Eup' was a term that indicates the several types of small districts such as town or village etc. So we need to bear in mind that the terms we are using cannot be stretched to other period of time.

Now let's begin the content of this subsection.

The directions of the administrative district revision in the 1910s can be classified into two branches below.

As seen in the diagram, the intentions for the revisions in the 1910s have not been based on the real problems the inhabitants suffered. They were close to paper administration. The revision held in 1914 even did not have a proper map to contemplate for the work.

The two problems can be suggested for the revisions in the 1910s. First, the selection of the administrative district was inappropriate, i.e., the real-life area was frequently discordant with the administrative district. This was because most borderlines were drawn running along streams and rivers. However, mountains, one of the toughest barriers dividing the life zone, were not considered.

Second, in many Myeons, the local finance became very weak. The problem stems from the fact that the criteria for rearrangement of space were anachronistic. Because of the rapid change in Myeon's expense, the district should be carefully selected, considering an elastic adjustment of tax revenue. However, the criteria used for the revision did not provide the elasticity of tax revenue.

Because of the two problems, the re-revision of the administrative district became an issue.

### 2) The expedient policy and polarization of the terminal administration districts

The Government-General of Chosen underlined the stable management of Myeons. Among possible solutions, changing priority of finance from the central government to the local governments could be a fundamental solution that did not need revision of administrative district. The solution includes ease of local levy restrictions, consistent subsidies, and supports for local officials' wage.

However, the Government-General refused to reduce the concentration of finance to the center. The authority rather preferred the concentration to cope with the increase in local expenditure. Moreover, the only subsidy allowed by the authority was for support of grand scale SOC (Social Overhead Capital) investments. Therefore, the available two solutions for the problems were total revision of local districts and reorganization of problematic districts. The former entails 'political affair,' since such revision frequently involves adjustments of interests. As a result of the Government-General's favor of expediency, the later was chosen.

We can see the consequences of the policy choice in the first table. From the table, we can see that in 1917-1927, the selected Myeons⋅Eup increases, while merges of ordinary Myeons were dull due to the authority's guideline not to allow them unless for special cases. From 1928 to 1936, this trend breaks. The merges of Myeons are active due to the reorganization of problematic districts as a result of the process above. The tendency sustains until 1945 and moreover, Bu and Eup soars due to industrialization of northern cities during wartime condition. The development of Bu and Eup even accelerated the decrease of Myeons, since they absorb Myeons nearby.

## 3. Merge of Myeons and Change in Their Names (Unfinished)

### 1) Clearance of weak Myeons and enlargement of cities

Myeons had their original services and had services that were received by the upper class administrations, such as social id, taxing, and election service. Thus, the administrative power of Myeons critically affected the Government-General's colonial rule of Joseon. The authority increased the number of local officials per Myeon (who were called 'Myeon Seo-ki') from 3.62 to 5.19 in average. The increase in the number leads to the increase in levy of the members of a Myeon.

However, the villagers in Myeon were already bearing cumbersome burden because of the soar in levy that stemmed from the construction of elementary schools for Joseon people. The situation led the Government-General to determine the revision policy that includes the merge of Myeons.

As the merge of Myeons become visible, the people of Myeons started social movements to avoid possible burden they may carry. Especially, in the 1930s, two affairs spark up such acts.

To cope with these two problems, the authority had to again come up with the merge of Myeons. By merging weak Myeons, the Government-General could met the end of constructing elementary school per Myeon faster. Moreover, by the merge with the richer Myeons, the poorer Myeons could disperse their levy since some of the taxes were imposed with respect to assets. As a result, in the perspective of the authority, merge of Myeons became the most favorable selection and led them to the second revision of local districts.

The further increase in financial pressure in the late 1930s stimulated the third revision. The two backgrounds that induced the increase are as follows.

### 2) Enhancement of relevance of social reality and administrative efficiency
