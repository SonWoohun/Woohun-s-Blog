This is the summary of the paper by Lee Myeong Hak (2020. 05), the title of which is **_<The Reorganization of Administrative Districts and Changes to Their Names during the Japanese Rule --With a focus on Myeons (面)-->_**.
The reason for reading this paper is to clarify the changes that were executed in rural societies of the Colonial Joseon and understand the motivation for the changes.

## Abstract

In the abstract, the paper is summarized as follows.
> As the number of Myeons increased which had to worry about their own existence, the Governor-General of Korea took on unifiying Myeons with inferior financial conditions. As a consequence, the division and arrangement of Myeons took place around the nation until the Liberation. The first period (1917~27) witnessed a prominent increase in the number of designated Myeons with the merger of Myeons lagging behind. The second period (1928~36) saw the active arrangement of Myeons driven by the one school for one Myeon system, town planning, and residents' voluntary demand. The third period (1937~45) featured the rapid increase of Eups and the unification of Myeons with poor finance simultaneously. The names of Myeons were first decided based on their own efforts and the unique features of their areas. On a secondary level, names of Myeons were created by borrowing and combining one letter from each of the concerned Myeons. Furthermore, the old names of Myeons were changed due to the unification of names for the seats of Kun offices, adjustment of confusion according to the addition of new administrative districts, and alteration of representative names commonly used in reality. That is, the people of Joseon began to reorganize their own identity based on new administrative districts and names in 1914.

## 1. Introduction (unfinished)

The Government-General of Chosen implemented the first administrative district revision in 1914, intending to make each administrative districts that give equal tax revenue. However, such revision was not constructed on the actual administrative needs; thus, Myeons that cannot meet their own expense increased. In reaction to the situation, the authority revised the administrative district rather than implementing a local finance mediation system. The decision was because the Government-General preferred central finance to local finance and was unaware of the importance of local financial balance. Therefore, the foreign government started the revision project on a full scale in the late 1920s.

In most of the cases, the authority had to merge two or more Myeons into one, which outbroke the issue of which name should be used. For the villagers at the time, the name of their Myeon (which is about a scale of town) was touchy matter, since their original name contains the identification of the members. The problem of naming the merged Myeons demanded understandable criteria for the villagers. This is why studying the district revision of 1920s are critical in comprehanding the rural governing system.
