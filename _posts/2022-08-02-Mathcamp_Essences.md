Here, I will list up important definitions and theorems that must be remembered, and objects or properties that was hard for me to understand. So, the materials covered in this page may be rather subjective and does not follow the materials of the mathcamp in OSU as a whole. I will add subjects that is from other texts such as "Mathematics for Economists" (Simon & Blume) or "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" (Walter Rudin). Moreover, to modify the definitions and theorems to be easily remembered, I will actively use abbreviation of notations.

## Set and Logic



## Relation and Function


## Vector Space, Metric Space, Limit, and Continuity


## Vector Subspace and Affine Subspace


## Convexity and Seperating Hyperplane
